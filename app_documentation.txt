## About the application

- the app can be used to estimate averagely daily intake of calories [in kCal]
- average calories intake depends primarily on

1. age of a person [years]
2. weight of a person [kilograms]
3. height od a person [centimetres]
4. and a gender of a person [male vs. female]

- and other factors not included in estimation





## Formula of the estimation

- the estimation is based on Harris - Benedict equation

- for females it is

BMR = 655.1 + 9.6 * weight [kg] + 1.8 * height [cm] - 4,77 * age [years]

- for males it is

BMR = 66.5 + 13.8 * weight [kg] + 5.0 * height [cm] - 6.8 * age [years]

- where BMR is basal metabolic rate [kCal]





## An example

- for a male with weight = 70 kg, height = 175 cm and age = 30 years, we get BMR = 1668.2 kCal

- for a female with weight = 65 kg, height = 170 cm and age = 30 years, we get BMR = 1427.5 kCal





## Some discussion

- for extreme values the estimation gives unexpected results (and is not so reliable)

- when other variables are fixed, females generally should take less calories than males

- more activities a person do during a day, more calories shoul he or she take - there is a coefficent >1 which should be BMR multiplied by
